1. Use proper commit messages. To update, 
    - screens = [screens]: <your message>
    - workflows = [workflow]: <your message>
    - test = [test]: <your message>
    - readme and others = [misc]: <your message>

2. Run `flutter test` and check if it's passing, update them as needed.
3. All the workflow checks must pass.
4. Follow dart's UpperCamelcase, lowerCamelcase formats when creating variables.
5. Don't commit a lot of changes at once.
